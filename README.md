# infrared-moisture-shrub-test
An analysis of infrared technology to assess soil moisture patterns associated with shrubs in deserts.

A Seek Compact Thermal Imager for iOS was tested in desert ecosystems in conjunction with a soil moisture probe on shub-open micoenvirnments. The hypothesis is that shrub canopy decadence is an important factor mediating shrub effects on microenvironmental dynamics.
